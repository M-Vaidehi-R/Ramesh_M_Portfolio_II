                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>
                Hello, I'm Mamatha Vaidehi Ramesh, and I'm excited to be a part of the web development community. As a current web development student at Fanshawe College in London, ON, Canada, I'm constantly pushing myself to improve my skills and take on new challenges. I'm an aspiring full-stack developer, and I'm eager to apply my knowledge and creativity to help clients achieve their goals.
                <br><br>
                I'm currently in my final semester at Fanshawe and will be graduating in May. Throughout my program, I've found that coding is my favorite part of web development, and I've gained a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other programming languages. The Interactive Media Design course at Fanshawe has been an amazing experience for me. I've learned everything from web development to 3D modeling, motion design, and graphic design from some of the best professors in the industry.
                <br><br>
                If you're looking for someone who is passionate, dedicated, and always striving to improve, then I'm the developer for you. Whether you need a simple website or a complex web application, I'm ready to take on any project and deliver outstanding results. Let's work together to make your ideas a reality.
